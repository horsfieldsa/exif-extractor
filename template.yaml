    exif-extrator

    Extracts exif data from images uploaded to S3 Bucket and data in a DynamoDB Table. When you deploy this application
    you will provide a bucket name to be created where images will be uploaded. Once images are uploaded an event will trigger
    a Lambda function which will extract EXIF data from the image, and insert it into a DynamoDB table.
